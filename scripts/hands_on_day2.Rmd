# Hands on 2

1) Go to the directory and list the files

```{bash}
cd ../data/ho2/ && ls -l
```

2) Count lines that start with a ","

```{bash}
grep -E "^," happiness.csv | wc -l
```

3) Convert csv into tsv

```{bash}
sed 's/,/\t/g' happiness.complete.csv > happiness.complete.tsv
```

4a) Count unique countries

```{bash}
cut -f1 happiness.complete.tsv | sed 1d | sort | uniq | wc -l
```

4b) Count how many entries of each gender

```{bash}
cut -f2 happiness.complete.tsv | sed 1d | sort | uniq -c
```

4c) Replace all spaces with “_” within the same file

```{bash}
sed -i '' 's/ /_/g' happiness.complete.tsv
```

4d) Write a new file in which all the countries are written in lowercase

```{bash}
awk '{print tolower($1) "\t" $2 "\t" $3 "\t" $4}' happiness.complete.tsv > happiness.complete.lower.tsv
```

4e) Replace gender column

```{bash}
sed -e 's/Male/M/' -e 's/Female/F/' -e 's/Both/B/' happiness.complete.tsv | head -10
```

4f) New file with "Both" entries from the countries in the list

```{bsh}
grep -f countries.txt happiness.complete.tsv | awk -F " " '/Both/ {print $4 "\t" $3 "\t" $1}' > happiness.complete.both.countries.tsv
```

# Hands on 3

1) Go to directory and list the contents

```{bash}
cd data/ho3 && ls -l 
```

2) Write a file called `samples.txt`

```{bash}
ls *fastq | sed "s/_R.*.short.*//" > samples.txt
```

3) Convert fastq to fasta

```{bash}
for file in $(ls *fastq)
do
	fasta=${file%fastq}fasta
	awk 'NR%4 == 1 {print ">" substr($0, 2)}
    	 NR%4 == 2 {print}' $file > $fasta
done
```

4) Re name reads

```{bash}
for file in $(ls *fasta)
do
	sample=${file%_R*.short*}
	sed "s/>/>${sample};/" $file > ${file%.fasta}.withname.fasta
done
```

5) Calculate read lengths

```{bash}
for file in $(ls *.withname.fasta)
do
	grep ">" ${file} | sed -e 's/;/\t/' -e 's/>//' > rs_names.txt
	grep -v ">" ${file} | awk '{ print length($0) }' > rs_lengths.txt
	paste rs_names.txt rs_lengths.txt > rs.tmp
	cat rs.tmp >> readLengths.txt
done

# Get summary
echo "Sample	ReadLengths"
cut -f1,3 readLengths.txt | sort -u | uniq 
```
